The only problem, with his claim is that this exponential growth results from legislation signed by Obama in his first term.

Rain creeps higher into the mountains more often every year.   If subtropical storms become more frequent and dump rain at higher elevations, then reservoirs will need to be kept lower to accommodate snow melt and avoid flooding. <br/><br/>Pretending there is and will be predictable water supplies into the future is not sensible. It will vary greatly from year to year as the state experiences years of drought mixed with years of heavy, but likely warm precipitation.  <br/><br/>Additional storage can be part of a solution, but the problem is too large to solve in that fashion alone. The agricultural sector needs to do smart business planning when deciding if it is a prudent investment to plant thousands of acres of trees or other crops that require a certain amount of water annually. Unfortunately, there is not an honest exchange of information around the issue, meaning we will end up responding to a crisis as they are in Cape Town rather than preventing one.

Your points: (1) Trump came across as normal last night; (2) it's when we treat Trump as normal that he's least effective; (3) he revels in the circus; (4) we should treat him more like a bad president and less like a cartoon villain. In other words, we should focus on what he does – and, if I may add, what the rest of the GOP does - rather than speculating about his IQ or mental health or other character flaws. Making fun of Trump's personality and even physical traits may feel cathartic, but it is fodder for his base and excuses the rest of the GOP.  An example is Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment.  While we were sharing memes that poked fun at his base (comments which, by the way, misinterpreted what she said), his base was using it as a rallying cry – proof of our contempt for them and more reason to vote for Trump. <br/><br/>And may I suggest the problem is not the Democratic leadership?

Nassar was one of the main factors that I was able to continue to pursue gymnastics after several injuries. I developed an online acquaintance with Nassar at the age of 14 when I injured my ankle at a meet and reached out for help from him when financial hardships made it nearly impossible for me to receive proper physical therapy to resume training. When the IndyStar story first broke, I remember feeling shocked and confused. I didn’t want to believe that the “doctor” that I had briefly come to know, could do such a thing. Later learning that he abused over 100 gymnasts, including those who I looked up to while growing up, I was mortified.<br/>	Seeing all the opportunities that USAG and others had to stop/prevent this horrendous abuse is sickening. I’m not only angry, but conflicted. I don’t think that this should negatively affect the thousands of current, innocent gymnasts and all their hard work by “shutting USAG down.” However, ALL of Nassar’s enablers need to be held accountable. The removal of board members and the shutdown of The Ranch is just one tiny step in the right direction. The abusive culture that as been brewing within the sport needs to change.

As an adult, I assumed submitting to authority, never asking for raises or reporting questionable behavior would lead to professional rewards. How wrong I was! <br/><br/>As a society, we wonder why women haven’t spoken up against sexual harassment and assault – the answer lies in front of us in the Larry Nassar trial.

I have hope we can stamp out the culture of submission in gymnastics. Gymnasts are the strongest, toughest girls of their generation.

Watching Maggie Nichols compete in NCAA just a few days after she came out as Athlete A, gave me a new appreciation for her strength and bravery.<br/>The sport needs a culture change. There should be a respectful relationship between coaches, athletes, and parents, with open communication. Too many times have gymnasts been told to act like everything is okay because their spot on a team, or a medal is on the line, when they are barely holding on both physically and mentally. The weight-shaming also needs to go. Former national team members have described developing eating disorders in efforts to ""lose weight"", which is unsafe and just sad. In all, we need to prioritize the well-being of the athletes over anything else, and that can start by having people in charge who put athletes first (such as Aimee Boorman), hiring a nutritionist, and maybe hiring a third party to closely monitor the environment for any signs of abuse.<br/>I do still love the sport. One of the biggest positives from this situation is that we saw the gymternet really come together in support of all the survivors.
